brief: The client wanted animated gifs using an existing face 'mascot' used for the brand. The brand is beauty focused and the images are to accompany short messages on social media.
solution: The company markets to ages 18 - 35. It was Black and white and high contrast has an air of sophistication but I also chose to add a pop of the brand's main pink colour to keep it fun. Accent shapes are feminine.
