brief: CSTE (Cyber Skills Training Environment) is a digital training portal for cyber security experts. As part of their product launch, the brand required an array of marketing collateral and a brand logo. Their parent company Nova colours (blue and red) needed to be considered.  
solution: "cyber"-flavoured graphics that can be used in both digital and print media (website, brochures, standing banners) as part of marketing collateral.
