brief: This is the first instalment of a typography series where I teach myself different effects in various Adobe programs. It is also an opportunity to get some ideas out of my head. 
solution: Honey effect. At the E3 gaming conference this year, Playtonic Games announced Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair! a 2D platforming adventure hybrid. The game is set in a bee kingdom and I was inspired to try a honey-like effect in Photoshop.
