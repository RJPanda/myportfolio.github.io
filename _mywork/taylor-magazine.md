brief:
  - The client is Taylor Magazine, a monthly 96pg publication with a contemporary, creative, eccentric, individual, clean and ‘handmade edge’ look and feel. The job had two parts. First to illustrate two alternate covers based on one of the six features articles that month. Secondly to do layouts for these articles along with the contents pages, all within keeping with the vibe of the magazine.
solution:
  - I chose to use a formal, symmetrical grid structure and clean minimalist style to carry through both the covers and spreads. My covers are my interpretation of one of the articles on the mysterious and private artist Stanley Donwood (the creative mind behind Radiohead’s album art).
