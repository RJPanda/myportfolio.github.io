brief: The client is an Australian brewing company called Kinns Ale whose core values revolve around creating premium hand-crafted beers that are suitable for the Australian palate.
solution: The client had two unique characteristics that helped with the design concept. Firstly they were originally Scottish settlers. Secondly, their beer is famous for being brewed with water from a secret spring. I wanted to have a strong bond between water, Australia and Scotland. So my new beer is called Fiere (pronounced feer) â€“ Scottish word for comrade, mate or companion. And My logo is a Scottish otter and an Australian Platypus frolicking in the water together.
