brief: The core issue addressed in this project is the depopulation of small towns in Rural Queensland. What model of community would it take to build a thriving rural district?
solution: Technical solutions aside, this is a map I made for this project. The visual concept was to capture the strong sense of rural community in the Western Frontier. Stylistically it takes its influence from Tolkien and video game maps.
