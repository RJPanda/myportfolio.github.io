brief: A selection of my work from the pharmaceutical company Bio Concepts - Packaging ideas for an international product launch. Pure Innovation logo redesign. Illustration for a textbook on addiction. Slide deck for product launch.  
solution: Product range focuses of minimal, high quality ingredients. Ingredients are intended to enhance the qualities of each-other. A nod to the Australian packaging with the mosaic pattern. Keywords, Simple, pure, minimal, synergy, science.
