brief:
  - In the aftermath of the 2011 floods in Brisbane, it was clear that certain systems were less resilient to change than others. I chose to focus on the public transport system, which shut down almost entirely in the aftermath of the floods.

solution:
  - This project aimed to amend and expand Brisbane’s existing Ferry system (both physical forms and operation). Its ultimate objective was to promote a more flexible and durable transport system with a higher capacity to cope with disturbance. This is one of the diagrammatic maps I made (based on Harry Beck’s famous London Underground Tube map) to show the major connection points along the Brisbane river.
